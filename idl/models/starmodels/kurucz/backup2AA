THE STELLAR ATMOSPHERE MODELS BY CASTELLI AND KURUCZ 2004

The atlas contains about 4300 stellar atmosphere models for a wide
range of metal abundances, effective temperatures and gravities. These
LTE models, with no convective overshooting computed by Fiorella
Castelli, have improved opacities and abundances upon previously
used by Kurucz (1990). The main improvements from previous opacity
distribution functions listed in Castelli & Kurucz 2003 (IAU Symposium
210, Modelling of  Stellar Atmospheres, Uppsala, Sweden, eds. N.E. Piskunov,
W.W. Weiss. and D.F. Gray, 2003, ASP-S210) are;

1- the replacement of the solar abundances from Andres & Grevesse
(1989, GCA,53,197; AG89) with those from Grevesse & Sauval (1998
Space. Sci.  Rev.,85,161; GS98). See Table 2 of Castelli & Kurucz 2004.

2- The replacement of the TiO lines provided by Kurucz (1993) with the
TiO lines from Schwenke (1998, Faraday Discuss., 109,321). Addition of
the H_2 O lines (Partridge & Schwenke 1997, J. Chem.  Phys., 106, 4618)
and of the HI-HI and HI-H+ quasi-molecular absorptions near 1600 A
and 1400 A (Allard et al. 1998, A&A, 335,1124), as distributed by Kurucz
1999a, 1999b. Extended molecular listand corrected previous bugs in
Kurucz line lists.

These models are computed with the same wavelength resolution and a
smaller temperature resolution than the Kurucz 1993 models. All the models
have the same number of plane parallel layers from log(tau_Ross)=-6.875
to +2.00 in steps of Delta[log(tau_Ross)] = 0.125, computed assuming a pure
mixing-length convection (no oveshooting) with 1/Hp=1.25. As before, the
microturbulent velocity used is 2 km s^{-1}.

The ATLAS9 installed in CDBS is from "The Grids of ATLAS9-ODFNEW
models and fluxes" from the Fiorella Castelli's web page
(http://wwwuser.oat.ts.astro.it/castelli/grids.html) and was created on
January 2007. These grids are also available from Dr. R. Kurucz
(http://kurucz.harvard.edu).

The ATLAS9 includes models for abundances [M/H]=0.0, -0.5, -1.0, -1.5,
-2.0, -2.5, +0.5, +0.2 and gravity range from log_g= 0.0 to +5.0 in
steps of +0.5. The range in effective temperature from 3500 K to 50000 K
is covered with an uneven grid (see Table 1a). The model spectra cover the
ultraviolet (1000A) to infrared (10 microns) spectral range with non-uniform
wavelength spacing (see Table 1b).

THE HST/CDBS VERSION OF THE ATLAS9 BY CASTELLI AND KURUCZ 2004

The new atlas is divided in 8 independent subdirectories, according to
metal abundance.  Within each subdirectory the stellar atmosphere models
are given in fits table format. Each table consist of 12
different columns, the first one containing the wavelength grid and
the rest containing the spectrum of a star with the same effective 
temperature but different gravity, ranging from log_g= 0.0 to
+5.0. Columns filled with zeros indicate that the model spectrum for
that particular metal abundance, effective temperature and gravity
combination is not covered by the atlas.

The names of the table files are given as cksmh_ttttt.fits where "ck", for
Castelli & Kurucz, are the first two letters of the atlas; "smh" is the
metal abundance of the model (mh) with its sign (s); and "ttttt" is the
model's effective temperature, using four or five digits depending on the
value. For instance, models for an effective temperature of 5000 K with
[M/H]= -0.5 and [M/H]= +3.5 are indicated by ttttt= 5000, s= m, mh= 05 and
ttttt= 5000, s= p, mh= 35, i.e. ckm05_5000.fits and ckp35_5000.fits.

Within each individual table file, each column is named "gyy", where
"yy" corresponds to 10*log_g. For example, log_g= +0.5 and log_g= +4.0
models are located in columns named g05 and g40, respectively. See the
appendix for an example of a standard header of a table file.

Physical fluxes of the spectra are given in FLAM surface flux units,
i.e. ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} A^{-1}. These flux units differ from those in
the Castelli & Kurucz tables by a factor of 3.336 x 10^{-19} x
lambda^{2} x (4pi)^{-1}, i.e. are converted from ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}
Hz^{-1}steradian^{-1} to ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} A^{-1} by mutiplying the
Castelli & Kurucz values by 3.336 x 10^{-19} x lambda^{2} x
(4pi)^{-1}, where lambda is in Angstroms. To convert to observed
flux at Earth, multiply by a factor of (R/D)^2 where R is the stellar
radius, and D is the distance to Earth.

The names of the files located in each metal abundance subdirectory are
listed in the README file located in each subdirectory. The range in
gravity covered by the models for the different temperatures is also
indicated.

USE OF THE ATLAS9 BY CASTELLI & KURUCZ 2004 WITH SYNPHOT

Synphot tasks permit the use of spectra selected from one of many
columns in a single fits table file.  One does this by specifying as
the "spectrum" parameter the name of the disk file (as before), and
appending the name of the column containing the flux in brackets. Thus,
to select any model spectrum characterized by a given metal abundance,
effective temperature, and gravity, specify a "spectrum" of the form:
crgridck04$m_directory/ckszz_ttttt.fits[gyy], where m_directory is the
name of the subdirectory for a given metal abundance. For example, to
select the spectrum of a star with a [M/H]= +0.1, a temperature
of 10,000 K, and log gravity of 3.0, the specification would be:
crgridck04$ckp01/ckp01_10000.fits[g30].

Please note that the model spectra in the atlas are in surface flux
units.  Thus, if the number of counts or the calculated absolute flux
is needed, the model spectrum must be renormalized appropriately.  One
can do this in synphot with the "rn" function.

Synphot also allows the use of the cat() and icat() functions to
select Castelli & Kurucz spectra. The syntax is "cat(ck04models,t,m,g)
where "t" is the effective temperature, "m" is the metal abundance
[M/H], and "g" is the log gravity.  The idea is that, instead of
having to remember a directory/file naming syntax, a synphot user
could specify a spectrum from a specified catalog (the New ATLAS9 of
Castelli & Kurucz, in this case) which most closely matches the specified
attributes (in this case, T_{eff}, [M/H], and log_g) using an expression.
The difference between the cat() and icat() functions is that cat()
selects the nearest spectrum to the specified parameters and icat()
interpolates between the spectra that bracket the specified
parameters.

Since the entire atlas occupies close to 70MB of disk space, many
applications could be satisfied by a copy of the solar abundance
spectra, only.

A list of solar abundance stars of different spectral types and luminosity
classes together with their closest Castelli & Kurucz 2004 model
spectrum is presented in Table 2. The physical parameters, T_{eff} and
log_g, characterizing each of the O stars are taken from Martins, 
Schaerer, & Hiller's compilation of stellar parameters of Galactic O 
stars (Martins, Scharer & Hiller 2005,A&A,436,1049). The physical 
parameters for later stars are taken from Schmidt-Kaler's compilation 
of physical parameters of stars (Schmidt-Kaler 1982, Landolt-Bornstein VI/2b). 
For the later, the U-B and B-V colors of the closest model agree with the 
characteristic color of each star (see Schmidt-Kaler 1982) to better 
than 0.06 magnitude. For the cool end, K5I, M0I and M2I stars, the physical 
parameters are taken from Leusque et al 2006, ApJ 645, 1102.

APPENDIX

Below is an example of a standard header for the table files in the
CDBS version of Castelli & Kurucz 2004 atlas. In this example the
name of the file is ckp00_8000.fits and contains all the models for a
star of [M/H]= 0.0 and effective temperature T_{eff}= 8000 K.
Models cover a range of gravities from log_g= +1.0 (g10 in the
header) to log_g= +5.0 (g50 in the header). Models for gravities
log_g= +0.0 and +0.5 are not available for this particualr metal abundance
and effective temperature combination, and therefore do not appear listed
in the header. Their corresponding columns (g00 and g05) are filled with
zeros. The models are in FLAM surface flux units,
i.e. ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} A^{-1}.
